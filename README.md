# Rank-Up Fitness

A Final Year Project using Flutter
Generally, I call this application Fitness Challenge System with Gamified Elements
This application can track user's daily progress while allowing them to take on challenge that can earn them EXP so that they can level up.
Why they want to level up? There is a leaderboard in this app where users' ranking is determined based on their level.
Users can also add another user to their friends list. By adding friend, users can see friends' progress while being able to challenge them to a game.
In the game, users can determine step goal for the match, then they will compete who can reach the goal first and the winner will gain EXP from it.

## Getting Started

In order to install this application, you can go to this folder path in this GitHub:
rankupfcc/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/
In this folder, you can find app-release.apk, you can download it and install it in your Android devices.

This app can be enhanced more in terms of design and features, but unfortunately it is because of lack of time to complete it during the last semester before presentation of the project.
