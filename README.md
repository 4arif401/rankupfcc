# Rank-Up Fitness

A Final Year Project using Flutter
Generally, I call this application Fitness Challenge System with Gamified Elements

## About the Project

This application can track user's daily progress while allowing them to take on challenge that can earn them EXP so that they can level up.
Why they want to level up? There is a leaderboard in this app where users' ranking is determined based on their level.
Users can also add another user to their friends list. By adding friend, users can see friends' progress while being able to challenge them to a game.
In the game, users can determine step goal for the match, then they will compete who can reach the goal first and the winner will gain EXP from it.

*Features Summarization*
1. Register: Users can register their account to access the app
2. Login: Users can insert their email and password that they registered to access the app
3. View daily progress: Users can view their daily steps, calories burnt and active time of the day and it will reset at 12.00 a.m.

6. Game: Users can select any of their friend to challenge them to a game where the player need to reach the goal by taking steps according to goal set by the challenger.

You can download it and install it in your Android devices.

This app can be enhanced more in terms of design and features, but unfortunately it is because of lack of time to complete it during the last semester before presentation of the project.
I also didn't manage to create an app logo for this app. But I think I will try to update this periodically when I have free time just for fun.
